# Code Tasks

## Overview

Code Tasks is an AI-assisted development workflow system that streamlines the complete software development lifecycle from initial task conception to production deployment. The system provides intelligent automation for code generation, review, and integration while maintaining human oversight at critical decision points.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **AI-Driven Development**: Leverages advanced AI agents to understand requirements, select relevant files, and generate high-quality code
- **Complete Lifecycle Management**: Handles everything from initial design to final deployment
- **Repository Integration**: Seamlessly works with local repositories, GitHub, and GitLab
- **Intelligent File Selection**: AI automatically identifies and selects relevant files for each task
- **Design-First Approach**: Generates comprehensive designs before code implementation
- **Diff Tracking**: Provides clear visibility into all code changes with detailed diffs
- **Branch Management**: Automatically creates and manages feature branches
- **CI/CD Monitoring**: Tracks continuous integration status and deployment progress
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Maintains human oversight with review stages at key decision points

## Workflow Stages

The Code Tasks system follows a structured workflow with distinct stages, each serving a specific purpose in the development process:

### 1. Initializing
The initial stage where the system processes the task requirements and prepares the development environment. During this phase, the AI analyzes the task description and sets up the necessary context for execution.

### 2. File Selection Review
The AI agent automatically identifies and selects files that are relevant to the task. This includes source files, configuration files, tests, and documentation that may need modification. The system presents these selections for human review and approval.

### 3. Updating File Selection
If the initial file selection needs refinement, this stage allows for adjustments. Users can add or remove files from the selection, ensuring the AI has access to all necessary context while avoiding irrelevant files.

### 4. Generating Design
Before writing any code, the system creates a comprehensive design document. This includes architectural decisions, implementation approach, API changes, database modifications, and any other technical specifications relevant to the task.

### 5. Design Review
The generated design is presented for human review. This critical stage allows developers to validate the approach, suggest modifications, and ensure the design aligns with project requirements and standards before proceeding to implementation.

### 6. Coding
The AI agent implements the approved design, generating code changes across the selected files. This includes new feature implementation, bug fixes, refactoring, and any necessary supporting changes like tests and documentation updates.

### 7. Code Review
All generated code changes are presented with detailed diffs for human review. Developers can examine the implementation, request modifications, and ensure code quality standards are met before proceeding to integration.

### 8. Committing
Once code changes are approved, the system creates commits with descriptive messages and pushes changes to the appropriate branch. This stage handles all git operations and ensures proper version control practices.

### 9. CI Monitoring
The system monitors continuous integration pipelines, tracking build status, test results, and deployment progress. It provides real-time updates on the integration process and alerts to any issues.

### 10. Completed/Error
The final stage indicates successful completion of the task or captures any errors that occurred during the process. Completed tasks include links to pull requests, deployment status, and summary information.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Access to a supported repository (local, GitHub, or GitLab)
- Proper authentication and permissions for repository operations
- CI/CD pipeline configuration (optional but recommended)

### Creating Your First Code Task

1. **Navigate to Code Tasks**: Access the Code Tasks interface from the main navigation
2. **Create New Task**: Click "New Task" and provide a clear, detailed description of what you want to accomplish
3. **Repository Selection**: Choose the target repository and branch for your changes
4. **Review File Selection**: Examine the AI's file selection and make adjustments if needed
5. **Approve Design**: Review the generated design document and provide feedback or approval
6. **Review Code**: Examine the generated code changes and approve or request modifications
7. **Monitor Progress**: Track the commit, CI/CD, and deployment process

### Best Practices

- **Clear Task Descriptions**: Provide detailed, specific requirements to help the AI understand your needs
- **Review Thoroughly**: Take time to review file selections, designs, and code changes carefully
- **Iterative Refinement**: Use the review stages to refine and improve the output
- **Test Integration**: Ensure your CI/CD pipelines are properly configured for automated testing
