Okay, let's break down the difference between document and query embeddings, especially in the context of retrieving code.

Think of it like this:

*   **`RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT`:** This task type is used to process the **things you want to store and search through**. In your case, these are your "chunks of code." You're essentially telling the model, "Hey, this is a piece of content (a document, or in this case, a code block) that someone might be looking for later. Generate an embedding that represents its core meaning as a retrievable item."
*   **`CODE_RETRIEVAL_QUERY`:** This task type is used to process the **user's search input when they are looking for code**. You're telling the model, "Okay, a user just typed this natural language phrase. They're looking for a piece of code. Generate an embedding for this *query* that will help us find the most relevant *code document* we stored earlier."

**Why the Distinction?**

The way a user asks for something (the query) is often very different from the thing itself (the document).

*   A **code block (document)** is literal code.
*   A **query for code** is often a natural language description of what the code *does* or what problem it *solves*.

The model needs to be optimized to understand this relationship.
*   When it sees `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT` and a code block, it focuses on creating an embedding that captures the *functionality and structure* of that code.
*   When it sees `CODE_RETRIEVAL_QUERY` and a natural language phrase, it focuses on creating an embedding that captures the *intent* behind that phrase, specifically the intent to find a piece of code.

The magic happens because the model is trained so that the `CODE_RETRIEVAL_QUERY` embedding for "a function to sort a list" will be very close in the embedding space to the `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT` embedding for the actual Python code `my_list.sort()`.

**Example: Indexing and Retrieving a Code Chunk**

Let's say you have the following Python function (this is your "document" or "chunk of code"):

```python
# This is the code_chunk_to_index.py
def calculate_factorial(n):
  """
  Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer.
  For example, factorial of 5 (5!) is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
  """
  if n < 0:
    raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
  elif n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
      result *= i
    return result

# Example usage (not part of the indexed chunk itself, just for context)
# print(calculate_factorial(5))
```

**Step 1: Indexing the Code Chunk (Creating the "Document" Embedding)**

You want to make this function searchable. So, you'll take the text of this function and embed it using the `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT` task type.

```python
from vertexai.language_models import TextEmbeddingInput, TextEmbeddingModel

MODEL_NAME = "text-embedding-005" # or another supported model

# Your code chunk as a string
code_to_index = """
def calculate_factorial(n):
  \"\"\"
  Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer.
  For example, factorial of 5 (5!) is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
  \"\"\"
  if n < 0:
    raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
  elif n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
      result *= i
    return result
"""

model = TextEmbeddingModel.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)
inputs = [TextEmbeddingInput(code_to_index, "RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT")] # Key part!
embeddings = model.get_embeddings(inputs)
document_embedding = embeddings[0].values

# Now, you would store 'document_embedding' in your vector database,
# associated with the original 'code_to_index' or a reference to it.
print(f"Generated document embedding for the factorial function (first 5 values): {document_embedding[:5]}")
```

**Step 2: User Searches for Code (Creating the "Query" Embedding)**

Later, a user comes along and wants to find a function that calculates a factorial. They might type a query like:

*   "python function for factorial"
*   "how to calculate factorial in code"
*   "code snippet factorial"

Let's take the query: "python function for factorial"

You'll embed this query using the `CODE_RETRIEVAL_QUERY` task type.

```python
user_query = "python function for factorial"

inputs = [TextEmbeddingInput(user_query, "CODE_RETRIEVAL_QUERY")] # Key part!
embeddings = model.get_embeddings(inputs)
query_embedding = embeddings[0].values

print(f"Generated query embedding for '{user_query}' (first 5 values): {query_embedding[:5]}")
```

**Step 3: Finding the Match**

Now you have:
1.  `document_embedding` (for the `calculate_factorial` function, created with `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT`)
2.  `query_embedding` (for "python function for factorial", created with `CODE_RETRIEVAL_QUERY`)

You would then use a vector similarity search (e.g., cosine similarity) to compare `query_embedding` against all the `document_embedding`s you have stored in your vector database.

Because the model is trained with these specific task types, the `query_embedding` for "python function for factorial" will be semantically very close to the `document_embedding` for the actual `calculate_factorial` code. This means your similarity search will rank the `calculate_factorial` function highly, even though the raw text of the query and the code are quite different.

**If you used the *wrong* task type or a *generic* one:**

*   If you embedded the code using `SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY` and the query also using `SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY`, the match might be weaker. The model wouldn't be specifically primed to understand the "natural language query for code" vs. "actual code block" relationship.
*   The `CODE_RETRIEVAL_QUERY` and `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT` pair is specifically designed to bridge this gap effectively for code search.

The document's Python example snippet has a slight mix-up in its `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. It should be:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Embeds code block (the document/corpus)
    code_blocks_text = [
        "def func(a, b): return a + b",
        "def func(a, b): return a - b",
        "def func(a, b): return (a ** 2 + b ** 2) ** 0.5",
    ]
    # For code blocks, use RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT
    code_block_embeddings = embed_text(
        texts=code_blocks_text, task="RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT", model_name=MODEL_NAME #, dimensionality=DIMENSIONALITY # dimensionality is optional for 005
    )
    print("Code block embeddings generated.")

    # Embeds a natural language query for code
    query_text = ["Retrieve a function that adds two numbers"]
    # For the query, use CODE_RETRIEVAL_QUERY
    code_query_embeddings = embed_text(
        texts=query_text, task="CODE_RETRIEVAL_QUERY", model_name=MODEL_NAME #, dimensionality=DIMENSIONALITY
    )
    print("Code query embeddings generated.")
```
This corrected version correctly assigns `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT` to the code blocks themselves and `CODE_RETRIEVAL_QUERY` to the natural language query asking for code.
