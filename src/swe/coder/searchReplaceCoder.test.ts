	// Tests for checkEditBlockFilePath are removed as the function is removed.
	// Its logic is now tested in:
	// - pathExistsRule.test.ts
	// - moduleAliasRule.test.ts
	// - similarFileNameRule.test.ts
	// - compositeValidator.test.ts (will test their combined behavior)

	// If there are other tests for SearchReplaceCoder class itself, they would remain.
	// For now, this file might become empty or be removed if SearchReplaceCoder itself has no other direct utils to test here.
	// Keeping the describe block for now in case other tests for SearchReplaceCoder are added later.
