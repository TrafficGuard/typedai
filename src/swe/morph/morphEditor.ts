	 * Use this tool to make an edit to an existing file.
	 *
	 * This will be read by a less intelligent model, which will quickly apply the edit. You should make it clear what the edit is, while also minimizing the unchanged code you write.
	 * When writing the edit, you should specify each edit in sequence, with the special comment // ... existing code ... to represent unchanged code in between edited lines.
	 *
	 * For example:
	 *
	 * // ... existing code ...
	 * FIRST_EDIT
	 * // ... existing code ...
	 * SECOND_EDIT
	 * // ... existing code ...
	 * THIRD_EDIT
	 * // ... existing code ...
	 *
	 * You should still bias towards repeating as few lines of the original file as possible to convey the change.
	 * But, each edit should contain minimally sufficient context of unchanged lines around the code you're editing to resolve ambiguity.
	 * DO NOT omit spans of pre-existing code (or comments) without using the // ... existing code ... comment to indicate its absence. If you omit the existing code comment, the model may inadvertently delete these lines.
	 * If you plan on deleting a section, you must provide context before and after to delete it. If the initial code is ```code \n Block 1 \n Block 2 \n Block 3 \n code```, and you want to remove Block 2, you would output ```// ... existing code ... \n Block 1 \n  Block 3 \n // ... existing code ...```.
	 * Make sure it is clear what the edit should be, and where it should be applied.
	 * Make edits to a file in a single edit_file call instead of multiple edit_file calls to the same file. The apply model can handle many distinct edits at once.
	 *
	 * @param filePath The path to the file to edit
	 * @param instructions A single sentence written in the first person describing what youâ€™re changing. Used to help disambiguate uncertainty in the edit.
	 * @param codeEdit Specify ONLY the precise lines of code that you wish to edit. Use // ... existing code ... for unchanged sections.
