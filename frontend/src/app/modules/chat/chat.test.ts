TODO: Consider adding integration tests for the chat module here,
      testing interactions between list, conversation, and info components.

When the New Chat button is clicked:
- It should show an empty chat conversation,
- The message input field should gain focus.
 Example Scenario for Integration Test:
- Selecting a chat from the list loads it into the conversation view.
- Starting a new chat clears the conversation view and focuses the input.
- Updating chat info reflects in the conversation header/details.
